    "We are going to explore and study a basic and important task of Natural Language Processiing (NLP) which is text classification. This task can help us with various tasks for example sentiments analysis, langauge detection, text author detection and text labelling are only few to name. In this Notebook, we will implement text's langauge detection task using two NLP approaches. First approach is with statistics and we will developed very famous Naive Bayes classifier. Second approach is with Machine Learning and there we will implement a very simple single layer Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. We will use Accuracy to compare both models performance (we could also use F1-measure but I want to keep things simple). I used vanilla Python for Naive Bayes implementation and Pytorch for LSTM. The dataset I use is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/basilb2s/language-detection) and it consist of text with their respective langauge label. The dataset contains text from 17 different languages, however I picked only 3 langauges with the most enteries (English, French and Spanish). I used 80% data for training and remaining 20% for validation.\n",
    "Any classification task can be further divided into binary or multi-class classification. Here as we picked 3 langauges so we are going to develop multi class classifier. Let's now start with Naive Bayes implementation.\n",

    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is one of the important statistical algorithm for text classification. It has two assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Bag-of-words assumptions:_ Position of words in text does not matter and we only consider word counts (each word is independent).\n",
    "2. _Conditional Independence_: Features (words) probabilities $P(w|c)$ are independent of each other given class c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is **naive** because of the **first** assumption. This is a strong assumption and **unrealistic for real data; however, this is very effective**. One thing two remember that both assumptions are incorrect, but they simplify the algorithm big time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes from lectures of Dan Jurafsky (highly recommend watching [these](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK8HbD2sPcUIDfQ7zmBarMYv) videos from him):\n",
    "- Small data ? Naive bayes is perfect\n",
    "- Reasonable amount of data? go with SVM or Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Huge data? Training ML models can be time consuming and here Naive Bayes will shine. Infact with enough data classifier wont even matter!\n",
