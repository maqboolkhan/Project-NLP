        "# Language Models\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the important and almost the backbone of different NLP related tasks! \n",
        "Let's assume we want to calculate the probability of a sentence  $P(S) = P(W_1 , … , W_m)$ or if we want to predict the next word given the probabilities of previous words $P(W_n|W_1 , … , W_m)$ then Language Model is the task which does it. Now, while calculating probability of next word given previous words usually we have to look back so far (in ideal situation, all the previous words). Thankfully, we use `Markov assumption` and only consider few words from the past. \n",
        "So, in this notebook we will first develop statistical and then Deep Learning approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's starts statistical methods. I mentioned about consideration of previous words, this is where the concept of `n-grams` kicks in. N in `n-grams` specifies number of words we want to look back for the prediction of next words! So how does this `n-grams` works?\n",
        "Suppose we want to generate a sentence from one single word `The`! then first step would be to find the most probable word after the word `The` and to find this most probable word we have to calculate probalities of all the words from the corpus given the word `The`. Trust me, it's not difficult as it sounds! \n",
        "Let's consider an example. Suppose we want to calculate the probability of word `company` occuring after the given word `The` $P(Company|The)$. So, we just need to calculate how many times `The company` occured in our corpus and then just normalized this count with number of times word `The` occured in our courpus. Hence, complete forumlar would be\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(Company|The) = \\frac{count(The, Company)}{count(The)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use same formula for all the words in our corpus and our next predicted word would be simply the word with highest probability. Hence, the more general form of above given formula can be written as \n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(W_i|W_{i-1}) = \\frac{count(W_{i-1}, W_i)}{count(W_{i-1})}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "When we consider single word from the past to predict next word is known as `bi-grams` approach for language modelling as we are considering two `(bi)` words. One thing to remember is that the more words we consider from the past the more better results we will get (you will see yourself in this notebook). So if you want to consider three words from the past we call them `tri-grams`. For `tri-grams` our forumula would simply include one more word.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(c|a,b) = \\frac{count(a, b, c)}{count(a,b)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "But there is one problem, if you want to use more previous words from the past which is `Sparsity` !. For example, from last formula what if we simply cant count $count(a, b, c)$ or $count(a, b)$ because these words never occured together! Then we have two solutions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Smoothing \n",
        "2. Backoff (if tri-gram is not avialable then use bi-gram if not then uni-gram)\n",
        "\n",
        "I would simply ignore these problems in this notebook 😬. However, at the end of this notebook I have provided helpful resources to study more about them. <br/>\n",
        "Another thing is, for every Artificial Intelligence problem or task we must evaluate our models on seperate validation and test sets. In fact, the best language model is one that best predicts an unseen test set. Here I am completely ignoring this as this notebook is more about understanding and implementation of LMs. Although, if you are going to use LMs in real scenarios you must use validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Statistical method\n",
        "\n",
        "Enough talk let's start coding. We will use `nltk` as it simplfies creation of `bi-grams` and `tri-grams`."

For this task, we can ask does our language model prefer good sentences to bad ones? does our model assign a higher probability to real or frequently observed word than ungrammatical or rarely observed one? Other than that we also have automatic measure which is `Perplexity`.

Following the same approach, the second input would be \"quick brown fox\" and output would be \"brown fox jumps\". The next `LMDataset` class implemented this logic and it takes `sentence_window` as its input.
